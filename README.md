# Top-Down Game Project 
Welcome to my top-down game project repository! My name is Tatiana Cerqueira and as an IT student seeking an internship in the game development field, this repository represents another step in my progress in mastering C++ language.

## Project Overview
This repository houses the code for a top-down game, a project developed as part of the coursework that I'm taking. Written in C++ and utilizing the raylib library, the game offers a classic top-down gaming experience, with the map designed on Tiled.

## Features
- Top Down Gameplay: Classic Top-Down game experience with a map created on Tiled and some pixel art assets for the animations.
- raylib Library: Leverage the power of the raylib library for efficient and straightforward handling of graphics, input, and window management.
- AI: Basic AI to make the enemy chase the character.
- Props: Added props that limits the movement of the character.
- Multiple enemies
